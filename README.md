# Work Timer

A simple React Native app that I built in my free time to help me track hours worked.
This app does almost exactly what the timer in the Android Clock app does with one
small difference. When you try to reset the timer on the Clock app, the app does not
ask for confirmation. I really needed that feature because I wanted to avoid accidentally
resetting the timer and losing track of hours I've worked for the day.

The app in its current state does not save day-wise records of the hours worked. Maybe
that's something I'd add in the future.

## Setup

Before you get started, make sure you've set up the [React Native development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

Clone this repository and then run `npm install` at the root directory. Then run the app using `npm run android`.
